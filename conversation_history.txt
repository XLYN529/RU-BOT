User: So what's this knight mover thingy?
Assistant: The Knight Mover is a service that provides transportation within or between all of the Rutgers University-New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses after the regular Intercampus Transit System (bus service) has stopped running for the night.

Here's what you should know about the Knight Mover:

*   **Availability:** It operates Monday through Thursday mornings from 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM during the Fall and Spring semesters. It does not operate Friday through Sunday mornings because the regular campus bus service is running.
*   **Who Can Use It:** The service is available to Rutgers University students, faculty, and staff. You'll need to show a valid Rutgers ID to the driver when you board.
*   **How to Use It:** You can access the service by calling their phone number. You can't reserve a pickup in advance; you need to be ready for immediate pickup when you call. New requests are not taken after 5:45 AM.
*   **Purpose:** It ensures that students, faculty, and staff can get around safely when the regular bus service isn't running.

User: who's a CSO?
Assistant: A Community Service Officer (CSO) at Rutgers University is a full-time student employed by the Rutgers University Police Department (RUPD). CSOs are uniformed and unarmed. They perform various safety and security functions on and off campus.

Here's what CSOs do:

*   **Patrol:** They patrol on foot, bicycle, in marked security vehicles, and sometimes on horseback.
*   **Security:** CSOs provide security at athletic events, special events, residence halls, and other campus buildings.
*   **Assistance:** They perform package checks, operate the Knight Mover shuttle, and provide after-hours escorts.
*   **Observation:** CSOs serve as the "eyes and ears" of the Rutgers University Police Department.

Many CSOs are interested in pursuing careers in law enforcement or public service. The CSO program provides valuable experience for students interested in these fields. All CSOs receive 40 hours of formal training through the New Jersey College and University Public Safety Association.
